                <p>Despite the commercial failure, the production won several accolades from specialized critics, as noted in the
                    76% TOMATOMETER , in addition to having conquered a legion of fans over the years and constantly being rediscovered. It is a film directed by Jon Favreau, based on the illustrated book by Chris Van Allsburg, author of Jumanji.</p> 
                    <p>The initial idea was that it was a continuation of this film, but it ended up taking on another form and Zathura became a great work that takes us on a great space adventure and marked the childhood of many people.</p>

            <p>As soon as the film was released, I managed to make a good profit in the first week of exhibition, even being in a good position of preference for films over the weekend.</p>
            <p>However, it ended up losing its audience very quickly due to the release of other franchises and the lack of popularity of the film. In the end, the profit ended up being less than half the budget (65 million) of the film, about 30 million dollars. Worldwide it reached about 60 million dollars.</p></div>

                <h1>Reviews</h1>
                <p class="grid-12">The film received generally positive reviews. It currently holds a 75% approval rating with "Certified Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes. Critic Cole Smithey said it "is a mediocre children's film based on a reworking of an already flawed formula generated by the same author." Piet Levy of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said "What really ruins this game is a complicated pair of bickering brothers at the heart of the tale whose relationship swallows up any potential excitement like a gigantic black hole."</p>
                <p class="grid-10">Jette Kernion of Cinematical wrote that "At times it felt like events were occurring just so the kids, or the kids in the audience, could learn the lesson a little more." Mike Clark of USA Today criticized the "overreliance on special effects". Betty Jo Tucker of ReelTalk said that "although full of incredible set pieces and a strong sense of adventure, "Zathura" soon becomes irritating to watch because of almost continuous screams by its young co-stars."</p>
                <img src="web/img/about/camiseta_Danny.png">
                <p class="grid-12">Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said "In seeking to entertain adults and children alike, director Jon Favreau (Elf) may have overreached his hand a little on the adult side." Roger Ebert was more complimentary in his review, saying the film "lacks the undercurrents of archetypal menace and genuine emotion that informed "The Polar Express", but it works gloriously as space opera.</p>
